NAME="xcb-util"
VERSION=0.3.9
RELEASE=1
CATEGORY="X11"
SUMMARY="XCB utility library"
DESCRIPTION="The xcb-util module provides a number of libraries which sit on
top of libxcb, the core X protocol library, and some of the extension libraries.
These experimental libraries provide convenience functions and interfaces which
make the raw X protocol more usable. Some of the libraries also provide
client-side code which is not strictly part of the X protocol but which have
traditionally been provided by Xlib."
